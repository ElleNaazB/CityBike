### Data Analysis:

- Summer vs Winter Hotspots 

The  visualization of Citibike data from New York City between April 2023 and May 2024 illustrates the distribution of start and end stations across certain parts of the city.  The visual data shows dense areas of Citibike usage particularly around central business districts and recreational zones. The concentration of activities in these areas is color-coded. Both maps show a high concentration of usage in specific areas.The areas with the densest concentrations of both start and end stations appear to be around downtown and midtown Manhattan, judging by the clustering of colorful dots. These regions are typically characterized by high commercial activity, numerous attractions, and heavy foot traffic, making them hotspots for bike-sharing usage.

As a result, there is a notable correlation between the locations of start and end stations, suggesting well-planned station placement. However, certain areas show a higher density of end stations compared to start stations or vice versa, which could indicate commuting patterns, such as residential areas having more starts in the morning and more ends in the evening.
